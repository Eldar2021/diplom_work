# Git

Git is a popular tool used as a distributed version control system (VCS). It is widely used for code storage, collaboration, and version control.

### What is Git?

Git is a VCS that allows you to track your projects, manage changes, and collaborate. It stores your code in a repository and facilitates working with multiple developers on the same project.

Example usage of a Git command:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add files to track changes
git add file.py

# Create a commit to save the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
