## Classes in Dart

In Dart, classes are used to define objects. A class is a blueprint that describes the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.

### Declaring a Class

To declare a class in Dart, you use the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. Here's an example:

```dart
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  void sayHello() {
    print('Hello, my name is $name');
  }
}
```
In the above example, we declare a class named Person with two properties: name and age. We also define a method called sayHello that prints a greeting message using the name property.

## Creating Objects
To create an object from a class, you use the new keyword followed by the name of the class and parentheses. Here's an example:
```dart
void main() {
  Person person = new Person();
  person.name = 'John';
  person.age = 25;
  person.sayHello();
}

```
In the above example, we create a Person object named person and set its name and age properties. We then call the sayHello method on the person object to print the greeting message.

Classes in Dart provide a way to define and organize your code into reusable and logical units. They encapsulate data and behavior, making it easier to manage and maintain your code.
