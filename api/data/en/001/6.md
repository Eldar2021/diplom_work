## Comments in Dart

Comments are used to add explanatory notes or annotations to the code. In Dart, there are two types of comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

### Single-line comments

Single-line comments start with `//` and can be used to document a single line of code or provide additional information.

Here's an example:

```dart
void main() {
  // This is a single-line comment
  String name = 'John Doe'; // Initializing the name variable
  print('Hello, $name!'); // Printing a greeting message
}
```
### Multi-line comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. They are used to document multiple lines of code or provide more detailed explanations.

Here's an example:
```dart
void main() {
  /*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span across multiple lines.
  */

  String name = 'John Doe';

  /*
  Printing a greeting message
  using the name variable.
  */
  print('Hello, $name!');
}
```
Comments are ignored by the Dart compiler and do not affect the execution of the code. They are purely for documentation purposes and to improve code readability and maintainability.
