## Dart - What is Dart?

Dart is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It is commonly used for building user interface-focused applications, such as Flutter. Dart is an object-oriented language and supports both Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for development and Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation for creating high-performance applications.

Key features of Dart:
- Strong type system: Dart has a strong type-checking system, which helps catch errors during development and makes code more reliable.
- Garbage collection: Dart has automatic memory management through garbage collection, which reduces manual memory management tasks.
- Asynchronous programming: Dart provides built-in support for writing asynchronous code using `async` and `await` keywords, making it easier to handle operations such as fetching data from APIs.
- Rich set of libraries: Dart comes with a rich set of libraries that provide ready-to-use solutions for common tasks, including working with collections, manipulating strings, handling HTTP requests, and more.
- Cross-platform development: Dart allows you to build applications for various platforms, including mobile (Flutter), web (Dart web), and server-side (Dart VM).
