## Control Flow Statements in Dart

In Dart, you can control the flow of your program using various control flow statements such as if-else, for loops, while loops, and switch statements.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of these control flow statements:

```dart
void main() {
  int x = 10;

  if (x > 0) {
    print('x is positive');
  } else if (x < 0) {
    print('x is negative');
  } else {
    print('x is zero');
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    print('Current number: $i');
  }

  int count = 0;
  while (count < 3) {
    print('Count: $count');
    count++;
  }

  String fruit = 'apple';
  switch (fruit) {
    case 'apple':
      print('It is an apple');
      break;
    case 'banana':
      print('It is a banana');
      break;
    default:
      print('Unknown fruit');
  }
}
```
In this example, we have used if-else statements to check the value of x and print a corresponding message. We have also used a for loop to iterate from 0 to 4 and print the current number. Additionally, we have used a while loop to repeat a set of statements until a condition is met. Lastly, we have used a switch statement to match the value of fruit and print a specific message based on the case.

When you run this code, it will output the following:
x is positive
Current number: 0
Current number: 1
Current number: 2
Current number: 3
Current number: 4
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
It is an apple
