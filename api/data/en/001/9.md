## Enums in Dart

In Dart, an enum (enumeration) is a special data type that represents a set of named values. Enums provide a way to define a collection of constant values that can be used throughout your code.

### Declaring an Enum

To declare an enum in Dart, you use the `enum` keyword followed by the name of the enum. Here's an example:

```dart
enum Color {
  red,
  green,
  blue,
}
```
In the above example, we declare an enum named Color with three values: red, green, and blue. These values are constant and can be accessed using dot notation, such as Color.red, Color.green, and Color.blue.

### Using Enums
Enums can be used to represent a fixed set of options or states in your code. They provide better readability and type safety compared to using raw strings or integers.

Here's an example of using an enum:
```dart
void main() {
  Color selectedColor = Color.blue;

  if (selectedColor == Color.red) {
    print('Selected color is red');
  } else if (selectedColor == Color.green) {
    print('Selected color is green');
  } else if (selectedColor == Color.blue) {
    print('Selected color is blue');
  }
}

```
In the above example, we declare a variable selectedColor of type Color and assign it the value Color.blue. We then use a series of if statements to check the selected color and print a corresponding message.

Enums in Dart provide a way to define a limited set of values, making your code more expressive and less error-prone.
