## Imports in Dart

Dart provides the `import` keyword to include external libraries or files in your Dart code. Imports allow you to use classes, functions, and other elements defined in other files or packages.

### Importing libraries

To import a library, you can use the `import` keyword followed by the library's URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). The URI can be a relative or absolute path to the file or a package name.

Here's an example:

```dart
import 'dart:math';

void main() {
  double radius = 5;
  double area = calculateCircleArea(radius);
  print('The area of the circle is $area');
}

double calculateCircleArea(double radius) {
  return pi * radius * radius;
}
```
In the above example, we import the dart:math library using the URI dart:math. This allows us to use the pi constant and the pow function from the dart:math library to calculate the area of a circle.

### Importing files
You can also import files from your project using relative or absolute paths. This is useful when you want to split your code into multiple files for better organization and reusability.

Here's an example:
```dart
import 'path/to/my_file.dart';

void main() {
  printMessage();
}
```
In the above example, we import a file named my_file.dart located in the path/to directory. This allows us to use the functions, classes, or variables defined in that file.

Imports provide a way to modularize your code and make it more maintainable by breaking it into smaller files and reusing existing libraries.
