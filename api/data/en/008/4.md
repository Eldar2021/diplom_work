# Storage

Storage in Firebase allows you to store and serve user-generated content such as images, videos, and audio files. Firebase Storage provides secure and reliable cloud storage for your Flutter applications. You can upload and download files, as well as generate download URLs to access the stored files.

Here's an example of using Firebase Storage in a Flutter application:
```dart
import 'package:firebase_storage/firebase_storage.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final FirebaseStorage storage = FirebaseStorage.instance;

  Future<String> uploadFile() async {
    Reference ref = storage.ref().child('images/image.jpg');
    UploadTask uploadTask = ref.putFile('path/to/image.jpg');
    TaskSnapshot snapshot = await uploadTask.whenComplete(() => null);
    String downloadURL = await snapshot.ref.getDownloadURL();
    return downloadURL;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Storage Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              uploadFile().then((downloadURL) {
                print('Download URL: $downloadURL');
              });
            },
            child: Text('Upload File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
In this example, we import the `firebase_storage package` and create an instance of `FirebaseStorage`. The `uploadFile()` function demonstrates uploading a file to Firebase Storage. We specify the file path and destination using `storage.ref().child('images/image.jpg')` and `ref.putFile('path/to/image.jpg')`. After the upload is complete, we obtain the download `URL` using `snapshot.ref.getDownloadURL()`. Finally, we display the uploaded file URL when the button is pressed.
