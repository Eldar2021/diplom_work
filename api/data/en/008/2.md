# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users or systems accessing an application. In mobile and web applications, authentication is essential for securing user data and ensuring that only authorized users can access certain features or resources.

Firebase provides several authentication methods, including email/password authentication, phone number authentication, social media authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter), and more. Here's an example of using email/password authentication in a Flutter application with Firebase:
```dart
import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';

void main() async {
  // Sign in with email and password
  try {
    UserCredential userCredential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
      email: 'john@example.com',
      password: 'password123',
    );
    print('User ID: ${userCredential.user.uid}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Failed to sign in: $e');
  }

  // Sign up with email and password
  try {
    UserCredential userCredential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
      email: 'jane@example.com',
      password: 'password456',
    );
    print('User ID: ${userCredential.user.uid}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Failed to sign up: $e');
  }

  // Sign out
  await FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut();
  print('User signed out');
}
```
In this example, we first sign in a user with their email and password using `signInWithEmailAndPassword()`. If successful, we can access the user's unique `ID (user.uid)`. We then demonstrate signing up a new user with `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()`. Finally, we sign out the user using `signOut()`.
