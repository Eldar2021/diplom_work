## Styled Widgets in Dart Flutter

Styled widgets in Dart Flutter allow you to customize the appearance of your UI components using various styles such as colors, fonts, borders, and more. You can create visually appealing and unique interfaces by applying different styles to your widgets.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of styled widgets in Dart Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Styled Widgets Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Flutter!',
            style: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 24,
              color: Colors.blue,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
In this example, we have a styled widget `Text` that displays the text "Hello, Flutter!" in a customized style. The `TextStyle` class is used to define the appearance of the text with a font size of 24, blue color, and bold font weight.

When you run this code, it will display a screen with the app bar titled "Styled Widgets Example" and a centered text saying "Hello, Flutter!" with the specified style.
