# Setup Development Environment

To set up a Flutter development environment, follow these steps:

* Install Flutter SDK:
    * Download the Flutter SDK for your operating system from the official   Flutter website: flutter.dev.
    * Extract the downloaded package to a preferred location.
    * Add the Flutter SDK's bin directory to your system's PATH variable.
* Install Dart SDK:
    * Flutter uses Dart as its programming language. Download the Dart SDK from the official Dart website: dart.dev.
    * Extract the downloaded package to a location of your choice.
    * Add the Dart SDK's bin directory to your system's PATH variable.
* Set Up an Editor:
    * Select an editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for     Flutter development. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code,  Android Studio, and IntelliJ IDEA.
    * Install the Flutter and Dart plugins for your chosen editor.
* Verify Installation:
    * Open a terminal or command prompt and run flutter doctor. This command checks for any missing dependencies or configuration issues.
    * If any issues are found, follow the prompts to resolve them.
* Choose an Emulator or Simulator:
    * For Android app development, set up an Android emulator or connect a physical Android device to your computer.
    * For iOS app development, you'll need access to a Mac computer to run the iOS simulator or deploy apps to physical iOS devices.
* Create a New Flutter Project:
    * Open your chosen editor and create a new Flutter project using the Flutter CLI command flutter create project_name.
    * Navigate to the project directory using the terminal and run the app using flutter run.
    
By following these steps, you will have a working Flutter development environment ready for building cross-platform mobile applications. Happy coding!
