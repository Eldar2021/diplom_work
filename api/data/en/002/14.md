## Working with Fonts in Dart Flutter

Fonts play a crucial role in the visual design of your Flutter applications. Dart Flutter provides a simple way to work with custom fonts and use them in your app.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to work with fonts in Dart Flutter:

1. Add your custom font files (e.g., `.ttf` or `.otf` files) to a `fonts` folder in the root directory of your Flutter project.

2. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in your Flutter project.

3. Add the following lines under the `flutter` section:

   ```yaml
   fonts:
     - family: MyCustomFont
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/MyCustomFont-Regular.ttf
         - asset: fonts/MyCustomFont-Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
This specifies that the font family is "MyCustomFont" and includes regular and bold variants.

4. Save the pubspec.yaml file.

5. In your Dart code, you can now use the custom font. For example, you can apply the font to a Text widget:
``` dart
Text(
  'Hello, Flutter!',
  style: TextStyle(
    fontFamily: 'MyCustomFont',
    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    fontSize: 20,
  ),
),
```
This applies the custom font to the text with a bold style.

By following these steps, you can work with custom fonts in your Dart Flutter application and enhance the typography of your app.
