## Cupertino Widgets in Dart Flutter

Cupertino widgets in Dart Flutter are a set of UI components that follow the Cupertino design language, providing an iOS-like look and feel for your Flutter applications.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of Cupertino widgets in Dart Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoApp(
      home: CupertinoPageScaffold(
        navigationBar: CupertinoNavigationBar(
          middle: Text('Cupertino Widgets Example'),
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: CupertinoButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Button click event
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
In this example, we have a Cupertino widget `CupertinoButton` that represents a button with an iOS-style appearance. The button displays the text "Click Me" and triggers an event when clicked.

When you run this code, it will display a screen with a navigation bar titled "Cupertino Widgets Example" and a centered button labeled "Click Me", resembling the iOS user interface.

You can use a variety of Cupertino widgets available in Flutter to create iOS-like user interfaces and provide a consistent experience to your users.
