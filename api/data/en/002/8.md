## Stateless Widgets in Dart Flutter

Stateless widgets are a fundamental concept in Dart Flutter for building user interfaces. As the name suggests, these widgets are immutable and do not have any internal state. They are mainly used for representing static UI components.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of stateless widgets in Dart Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stateless Widgets Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Flutter!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
In this example, we have a stateless widget `MyApp` that extends `StatelessWidget`. The `build()` method is overridden to define the UI structure of the widget. It returns a MaterialApp with a `Scaffold` that contains an `AppBar` and a centered `Text` widget displaying the text "Hello, Flutter!".

When you run this code, it will display a screen with the app bar titled "Stateless Widgets Example" and a centered text saying "Hello, Flutter!" with a font size of 24.
