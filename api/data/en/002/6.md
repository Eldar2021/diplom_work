# Widgets

Widgets are an essential part of Flutter development. They are the building blocks of the user interface (UI) in Flutter applications. Widgets define the visual elements and layout of the UI, such as buttons, text fields, images, and containers.
In Flutter, there are two types of widgets: stateless widgets and stateful widgets.
* ` Stateless widgets ` are immutable and do not maintain any internal state. They are used for representing static UI elements that do not change over time.
* ` Stateful widgets ` are mutable and can maintain internal state that can change over time. They are used for representing dynamic UI elements that can be updated or respond to user interactions.

Flutter provides a rich set of pre-built widgets that can be used to create complex UIs. These widgets are highly customizable and can be composed together to build custom UI components. Additionally, Flutter allows developers to create their own custom widgets by extending existing ones or building from scratch.

Widgets in Flutter follow a hierarchical structure called the widget tree. The widget tree represents the UI structure, with parent widgets containing child widgets. This hierarchy allows for easy composition and organization of UI elements.

Flutter also offers a feature called "hot reload," which allows developers to see the changes made to the UI in real-time without restarting the application. This feature significantly speeds up the development process and makes it easier to iterate and refine the UI.
