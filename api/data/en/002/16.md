## Working with Other File Types in Dart Flutter

In addition to images, Dart Flutter allows you to work with other file types in your application. You can load and display files such as PDFs, videos, audio files, and more.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to work with other file types in Dart Flutter:

1. Add the file you want to work with to the appropriate location in your project. For example, if you want to work with a PDF file, place it in a `assets` folder.

2. Update the `pubspec.yaml` file to include the file as an asset:

   ```yaml
   assets:
     - assets/my_file.pdf
   ```
Make sure to adjust the file path based on the actual location of your file.

3. In your Dart code, use the appropriate widget to display the file. For example, you can use the PDFViewer widget from the flutter_pdfview package to display a PDF file:
``` dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pdfview/flutter_pdfview.dart';

class MyFileApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('File Example'),
        ),
        body: PDFViewer(
          filePath: 'assets/my_file.pdf',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
Adjust the widget and package based on the file type you are working with.

4. Run your app, and you should see the file displayed or rendered based on its type.

By following these steps, you can work with various file types in your Dart Flutter application and incorporate them into your user interface.
