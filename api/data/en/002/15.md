## Working with Images in Dart Flutter

Images are an important part of building visually appealing Flutter applications. Dart Flutter provides various ways to work with images and display them in your app.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to work with images in Dart Flutter:

1. Add your image files (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.gif`) to a `images` folder in the root directory of your Flutter project.

2. In your Dart code, import the `flutter` package and use the `Image` widget to display an image:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

   class MyImageApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         home: Scaffold(
           appBar: AppBar(
             title: Text('Image Example'),
           ),
           body: Center(
             child: Image.asset('images/my_image.png'),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```
This example uses the Image.asset() constructor to load an image from the images folder in your project.

3. Run your app, and you should see the image displayed on the screen.
By following these steps, you can work with images in your Dart Flutter application and enhance the visual aspects of your app.
