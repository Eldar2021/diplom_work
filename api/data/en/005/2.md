# Flutter Pub and Dart Pub
Flutter Pub and Dart Pub are package managers for managing dependencies in Flutter and Dart projects. They provide a convenient way to discover, install, and use third-party packages or libraries in your projects.

To use a package from Flutter Pub or Dart Pub, you need to add it as a dependency in the `pubspec.yaml` file of your project. Here's an example:
```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.13.0
```
In this example, the `http` package is added as a dependency. The version constraint `^0.13.0` specifies that any version of the http package that is greater than or equal to `0.13.0 `and less than the next major version will be used.

Once you've added the dependency, you can run the `flutter pub get` or `dart pub get` command to fetch and install the package and its dependencies.
