# Pub dev

Pub.dev is the official package repository for Dart and Flutter. It is a platform where developers can discover, publish, and share packages to enhance their Dart and Flutter projects. Pub.dev hosts a wide range of open-source packages contributed by the community, making it easy to find and use libraries for various functionalities.

Here's an example of using Pub.dev in Dart Flutter:
```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.13.0
```
In this example, the `http` package is added as a dependency by specifying it in the `pubspec.yaml` file. This allows you to easily import and use the `http` package in your Dart Flutter project.
