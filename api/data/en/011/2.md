# Opacity
The Opacity widget in Flutter is used to adjust the transparency of its child widget. It allows you to control the visibility and fading effects of a widget by changing its opacity value from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque).

To use the Opacity widget, wrap the desired child widget with it and set the opacity property to the desired value between 0.0 and 1.0.
```dart
Opacity(
  opacity: 0.5,
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
  ),
)
```
In this example, the `Container`widget is wrapped with an `Opacity` widget. The opacity property is set to `0.5`,` making the container half-transparent. You can adjust the opacity value to achieve the desired visual effect.
