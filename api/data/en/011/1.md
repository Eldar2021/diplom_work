# Hero

The Hero widget in Flutter is used to create a transition animation between two widgets with a shared tag. It's commonly used to provide a smooth visual transition when navigating from one screen to another.

To use the Hero widget, you need to wrap both the source and destination widgets with it. The widgets should have the same tag property to establish the connection between them. When the transition occurs, Flutter automatically animates the visual changes between the widgets, such as size, position, and opacity.
```dart
// Source screen
class SourceScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: () {
        Navigator.push(
          context,
          MaterialPageRoute(
            builder: (context) => DestinationScreen(),
          ),
        );
      },
      child: Hero(
        tag: 'imageTag',
        child: Image.asset('assets/image.png'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Destination screen
class DestinationScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(),
      body: Center(
        child: Hero(
          tag: 'imageTag',
          child: Image.asset('assets/image.png'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
In this example, tapping on the image in the `SourceScreen` triggers a transition to the `DestinationScreen`. Both the source and destination images are wrapped with a `Hero` widget and assigned the same tag property. `Flutter` then automatically animates the image's transition between the screens.
