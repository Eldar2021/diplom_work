# Unit Testing
Unit testing is a software testing method used to verify the individual units of code (functions, methods, classes) work as expected. In Flutter, you can write unit tests using the flutter_test package, which provides tools and utilities for testing Flutter applications.

To write unit tests, create a separate test file and define test functions using the test() function from the flutter_test package. Inside the test functions, you can use assertions to check the expected behavior of the code.
```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  test('Test case description', () {
    // Test code and assertions
    expect(2 + 2, equals(4));
  });
}
```
In this example, a test case is defined using the `test()` function. Inside the test case, the `expect()` function is used to assert that the sum of 2 and 2 is equal to 4. If the assertion fails, the test will fail.
You can run unit tests using the Flutter test runner command: flutter test.
