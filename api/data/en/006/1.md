## Web Sockets in Dart Flutter

Web Sockets provide a communication channel between a client and a server over a long-lived connection. It allows real-time, two-way communication between the client and the server.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use Web Sockets in Dart Flutter:

1. Import the `web_socket_channel` package in your Dart code:

   ```dart
   import 'package:web_socket_channel/web_socket_channel.dart';
   ```
2. Create a WebSocket channel by providing the WebSocket server URL:

```dart
final channel = WebSocketChannel.connect(Uri.parse('ws://your-websocket-server-url'));
```
Replace 'ws://your-websocket-server-url' with the actual WebSocket server URL.
3. Send and receive messages using the WebSocket channel:
``` dart
// Sending a message
channel.sink.add('Hello, server!');

// Receiving messages
channel.stream.listen((message) {
  print('Received: $message');
});
```
4. Close the WebSocket connection when it's no longer needed:
```dart
channel.sink.close();
```
By following these steps, you can establish a WebSocket connection and exchange messages with a server in your Dart Flutter application.

Remember to handle exceptions and errors when working with Web Sockets for a robust and error-free communication.
