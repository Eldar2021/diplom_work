## REST in Dart Flutter

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It provides a set of principles for building web services that are scalable, stateless, and interoperable. Dart Flutter allows you to interact with RESTful APIs to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to perform REST API calls in Dart Flutter:

1. Add the `http` package as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     http: ^0.13.0
   ```
2. Import the necessary packages in your Dart code:
```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';
```
3. Make a GET request to retrieve data from the REST API:
```dart
final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/users'));
final data = json.decode(response.body);

// Process the retrieved data
// ...
```
4. Make a POST request to send data to the REST API:
```dart
final user = {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john.doe@example.com'};
final response = await http.post(
  Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/users'),
  body: json.encode(user),
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
);

// Process the response
// ...
```
5. Make a PUT request to update data in the REST API:
```dart
final user = {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john.doe@example.com'};
final response = await http.put(
  Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/users/1'),
  body: json.encode(user),
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
);

// Process the response
// ...
```
6. Make a DELETE request to remove data from the REST API:
```dart
final response = await http.delete(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/users/1'));

// Process the response
// ...
```
By following these steps, you can interact with RESTful APIs in Dart Flutter and perform various operations like fetching data, creating records, updating data, and deleting records.

Remember to handle errors and exceptions while making REST API calls for a robust and reliable application.
