# Isolates

In Dart Flutter, isolates are independent units of execution that run concurrently with the main isolate (UI thread) and communicate with each other through message passing. Isolates provide a way to perform heavy computations, execute I/O operations, or run code in parallel without blocking the user interface.

Isolates have their own memory space and don't share memory by default. This isolation ensures that isolates can't directly access or modify each other's data, enhancing the overall stability and performance of the application.

To create an isolate, you can use the `Isolate.spawn()` method and provide a function to be executed in the isolate. Isolates communicate by sending and receiving messages using `SendPort` and` ReceivePort` objects.

Using isolates in Dart Flutter is beneficial for scenarios where you need to offload CPU-intensive tasks, such as complex calculations or network requests, from the main isolate to maintain a responsive user interface.dart-asynchronous-programming-isolates-and-event-loops-bffc3e296a6a)
