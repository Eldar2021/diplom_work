# Lists

Lists in Dart are ordered collections of objects. They allow you to store and manipulate a sequence of values. Here's an example of working with lists in Dart:
```dart
void main() {
  // Creating a list
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  // Accessing list elements
  print(numbers[0]); // Output: 1

  // Modifying list elements
  numbers[2] = 10;
  print(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 10, 4, 5]

  // Adding elements to the end of the list
  numbers.add(6);
  print(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 10, 4, 5, 6]

  // Removing elements from the list
  numbers.removeAt(1);
  print(numbers); // Output: [1, 10, 4, 5, 6]

  // Iterating over the list
  for (int number in numbers) {
    print(number);
  }
}
```
In this example, we create a list called `numbers` containing integers. We can access elements in the list using index notation, modify elements by assigning new values, `add `elements to the end of the list using the add method, and remove elements using the `removeAt` method.

We can also iterate over the list using a for loop and perform operations on each element. Lists in Dart are dynamic, meaning they can grow or shrink in size as needed.

Lists provide various methods and operations for manipulating and working with the elements, such as sorting, searching, and filtering. They are widely used in Dart and Flutter applications for storing and manipulating data in a sequential manner.
