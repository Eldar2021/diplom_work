# Collections

Collections in Dart refer to data structures that can store multiple elements. Dart provides several collection types, including lists, sets, and maps, which offer different ways to organize and manipulate data.
# Lists
Lists, as discussed earlier, are ordered collections that allow you to store and access elements based on their indices.
# Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They do not allow duplicate values. You can add, remove, and check for the presence of elements in a set.
# Maps
Maps, also known as dictionaries or associative arrays, store key-value pairs. Each key in a map is unique, and it is used to retrieve the corresponding value.
# Examples
```dart
void main() {
  // Lists
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  List<String> names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];

  // Sets
  Set<int> uniqueNumbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  Set<String> uniqueNames = {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'};

  // Maps
  Map<String, int> ageMap = {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 30, 'Charlie': 35};

  // Accessing elements
  print(numbers[0]); // Output: 1
  print(names[1]); // Output: Bob
  print(uniqueNumbers.contains(3)); // Output: true
  print(ageMap['Charlie']); // Output: 35

  // Modifying elements
  numbers[2] = 10;
  names.add('Dave');
  uniqueNumbers.remove(4);
  ageMap['Bob'] = 31;

  // Iterating over collections
  for (int number in numbers) {
    print(number);
  }

  for (String name in names) {
    print(name);
  }

  for (int age in ageMap.values) {
    print(age);
  }
}
```
In this example, we demonstrate the usage of different collection types. We create lists, sets, and maps, and perform operations such as accessing elements, modifying values, and iterating over the collections.

Collections are fundamental in organizing and managing data in Dart applications. They provide efficient ways to store, retrieve, and manipulate groups of related values.
