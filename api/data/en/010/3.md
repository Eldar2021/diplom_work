# Lambdas

Lambdas, also known as anonymous functions or function literals, are a concise way to define small, reusable functions in Dart. They allow you to define a function without a name and use it immediately where it's needed.
# Syntax
The syntax for lambdas in Dart is as follows:
```dart
(parameters) => expression
```
or
```dart
(parameters) {
  // function body
  return expression;
}
```
# Examples
```dart
void main() {
  // Lambda as a parameter
  var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  numbers.forEach((number) => print(number));

  // Lambda as a variable
  var addNumbers = (int a, int b) => a + b;
  var result = addNumbers(5, 10);
  print(result);

  // Lambda with multiple statements
  var multiply = (int a, int b) {
    var product = a * b;
    return product;
  };
  var productResult = multiply(3, 4);
  print(productResult);
}
```
In the first example, a lambda is used as a parameter to the `forEach` method of a list. It prints each number in the list.

In the second example, a lambda is assigned to a variable `addNumbers`. It takes two parameters and returns their sum. The lambda is invoked with 5 and 10, and the result is printed.

In the third example, a lambda with multiple statements is defined. It multiplies two numbers and returns the product. The lambda is invoked with 3 and 4, and the product is printed.

Lambdas provide a concise and expressive way to define functions on-the-fly, making your code more readable and maintainable. They are commonly used in functional programming and with higher-order functions.
