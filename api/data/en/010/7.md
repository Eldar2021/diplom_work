# Streams

In Dart Flutter, streams are a powerful mechanism for handling and processing asynchronous data. A stream is a sequence of events that can be processed asynchronously as they occur.

Streams are used to handle data that arrives over time, such as user input, network responses, or data from sensors. They provide a way to reactively process and transform data as it becomes available.

A stream consists of two main components: a source and a listener. The source generates events and sends them to the stream, while the listener receives and processes these events. Streams can emit different types of events, and listeners can subscribe to specific types of events or process all events.

Using streams, you can apply various operations on the data, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, to transform and manipulate the incoming events. Streams also support asynchronous error handling and can be used with asynchronous control flow constructs like async/await.

Streams in Dart Flutter are widely used for handling real-time data, implementing reactive programming patterns, and building applications with dynamic and event-driven behavior.
