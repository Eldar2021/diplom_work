# Async Await

In Dart Flutter, the async/await keywords are used to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and sequential manner. Asynchronous programming allows executing tasks without blocking the execution flow, enabling smooth user interactions and responsiveness in applications.

The `async` keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous, indicating that it may perform asynchronous operations. An async function returns a Future object that represents the result of the asynchronous computation.

The `await` keyword is used within an async function to pause the execution until a Future completes and retrieves its result. While waiting for the Future to complete, the control flow is temporarily returned to the caller, allowing other tasks to execute concurrently.

Using async/await simplifies handling asynchronous operations, making the code easier to read and understand compared to traditional callback-based approaches. It enables developers to write asynchronous code that resembles synchronous code, leading to more maintainable and robust applications.
