# Firebase App Distribution
Firebase App Distribution is a powerful app distribution platform provided by Firebase. It simplifies the process of distributing pre-release and production versions of your mobile apps to testers and stakeholders. With Firebase App Distribution, you can easily distribute your Android and iOS apps, collect valuable feedback, and monitor app adoption. It integrates seamlessly with other Firebase products, making it a convenient solution for app distribution and testing.

Firebase App Distribution allows you to create distribution lists and invite testers via email, enabling them to easily install and test your app on their devices. You can distribute different versions of your app, including alpha, beta, and production releases. Firebase App Distribution also provides valuable insights into tester feedback, crash reports, and analytics to help you identify and resolve issues quickly.
# Example 
Firebase App Distribution does not require code snippets for configuration. Instead, it requires integrating the Firebase SDK into your app and using the Firebase Console to manage app distribution.
