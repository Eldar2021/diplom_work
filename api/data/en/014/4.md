# Github Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful workflow automation and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform provided by GitHub. It allows developers to automate their software development workflows directly within their GitHub repositories. With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and deploy your applications, as well as automate other tasks, all in response to various events such as code commits, pull requests, and issue updates.
