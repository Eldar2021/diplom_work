# SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help developers design and organize software systems that are easy to maintain, understand, and extend. Each letter in SOLID represents a principle:

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. It means that a class should have a single responsibility or a single purpose. By adhering to SRP, classes become more focused, maintainable, and easier to test.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The OCP states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. It means that you should be able to add new features or behaviors to a system without modifying its existing code. This promotes code reuse, reduces the impact of changes, and improves the overall stability of the system.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, the subclass should be able to substitute the superclass wherever the superclass is used. This principle ensures that inheritance hierarchies are well-defined and that polymorphism works correctly.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The ISP states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It promotes the idea of segregating interfaces into smaller and more specific ones, tailored to the needs of the clients. This reduces coupling, improves code clarity, and makes systems easier to maintain.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. It promotes loose coupling between modules by introducing abstractions and using dependency injection. This enhances flexibility, testability, and allows for easier changes in the system.

Understanding and applying SOLID principles can lead to more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems.
