# Design Patterns

Design Patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems in software development. They provide reusable templates that help in solving common design challenges, improving code structure, and promoting best practices. Here are some commonly used design patterns:

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the application. It is useful when you need a global point of access to a specific object, such as a database connection or a logger.

## 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows the client code to create objects based on certain conditions or configurations, providing flexibility and decoupling.

## 3. Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes in one object are automatically notified to other dependent objects. It is useful in scenarios where one object's state changes, and multiple objects need to be updated accordingly.

## 4. Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern dynamically adds behavior or responsibilities to an object without modifying its structure. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing, allowing you to add or modify object features at runtime.

## 5. Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern enables the selection of an algorithm or behavior at runtime. It defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulates each algorithm separately, making them interchangeable and easy to switch.

These are just a few examples of design patterns. There are many more patterns, such as Adapter, Facade, Template Method, and MVC, each addressing specific design scenarios.

Understanding and applying design patterns can greatly improve the flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability of your software applications.

For more in-depth explanations and examples of design patterns, refer to authoritative books such as "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Gang of Four (GoF).
