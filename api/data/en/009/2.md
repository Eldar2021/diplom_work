# BloC

The BloC (Business Logic Component) pattern is a popular state management pattern used in Flutter applications. It helps to separate the business logic from the UI and provides a clear separation of concerns. BloC is based on the concept of streams and helps manage the flow of data in an application.

Here's an example of implementing the BloC pattern in Flutter:

1. Define the Events: Create a class to represent the events that can occur in your application.
```dart
abstract class CounterEvent {}

class IncrementEvent extends CounterEvent {}

class DecrementEvent extends CounterEvent {}
```
2. Define the BloC: Create a class that extends the Bloc class from the flutter_bloc package and implement the event-to-state mapping.
```dart
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

class CounterBloc extends Bloc<CounterEvent, int> {
  CounterBloc() : super(0);

  @override
  Stream<int> mapEventToState(CounterEvent event) async* {
    if (event is IncrementEvent) {
      yield state + 1;
    } else if (event is DecrementEvent) {
      yield state - 1;
    }
  }
}
```
3. Use the BloC in UI: Wrap your widget with the BlocProvider widget and use the BlocBuilder widget to listen to state changes.
```dart
BlocProvider(
  create: (context) => CounterBloc(),
  child: BlocBuilder<CounterBloc, int>(
    builder: (context, count) {
      return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('BloC Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Count: $count',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,
          children: [
            FloatingActionButton(
              onPressed: () =>
                  context.read<CounterBloc>().add(IncrementEvent()),
              child: Icon(Icons.add),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            FloatingActionButton(
              onPressed: () =>
                  context.read<CounterBloc>().add(DecrementEvent()),
              child: Icon(Icons.remove),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    },
  ),
);
```
In this example, we define the `CounterEvent` class to represent the events, create a `CounterBloc` class that extends the `Bloc` class, and implement the event-to-state mapping. Then, we use the `BlocProvider` widget to provide the `CounterBloc` to the widget tree and use the BlocBuilder widget to listen to state changes and update the UI accordingly.

The BloC pattern helps manage the state of your application in a predictable and scalable manner. It promotes separation of concerns and improves code reusability and testability.
