# Provider Pattern
The Provider pattern is a state management pattern commonly used in Flutter applications. It allows you to share and manage application state in a simple and efficient way. Provider is part of the Flutter ecosystem and is often used in conjunction with other Flutter libraries, such as provider package.

Here is an example of using the Provider pattern in Flutter:

1. Define a Data Model: Create a data model class to represent the data you want to share.
```dart
class Counter {
  int count;

  Counter(this.count);
}
```
2. Create a Provider: Create a provider class that extends ChangeNotifier from the provider package. This class will hold the state and notify its listeners when the state changes.
```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

class CounterProvider with ChangeNotifier {
  Counter _counter = Counter(0);

  Counter get counter => _counter;

  void increment() {
    _counter.count++;
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void decrement() {
    _counter.count--;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```
3. Wrap Widgets with Provider: Wrap the widgets that need access to the state with the ChangeNotifierProvider widget.
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => CounterProvider(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Provider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Provider Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(
                'Count:',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              Consumer<CounterProvider>(
                builder: (context, provider, child) {
                  return Text(
                    '${provider.counter.count}',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Provider.of<CounterProvider>(context, listen: false).increment();
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
In this example, we define a `Counter` data model class to represent the counter value. Then, we create a `CounterProvider` class that extends `ChangeNotifier` and holds an instance of Counter. The provider class provides methods to increment and decrement the counter value, and it notifies its listeners when the value changes using `notifyListeners()`.

We wrap the root widget of our app with `ChangeNotifierProvider` to provide the `CounterProvider` to its child widgets. Inside the widget tree, we use the `Consumer` widget to listen for changes in the `CounterProvider` and update the UI accordingly.

By using the Provider pattern, we can easily share and manage the state of our application across different widgets in a reactive and efficient manner.

Provider is a powerful tool for state management in Flutter, offering simplicity and flexibility for managing application state.
