# RxDart

RxDart is a reactive extensions library for Dart programming language, inspired by ReactiveX. It provides a powerful set of tools and operators for reactive programming in Dart, allowing developers to easily work with streams and handle asynchronous events.

Here is an example of using RxDart to work with streams:
```dart
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

void main() {
  final subject = PublishSubject<String>();

  // Subscribe to the stream
  final subscription = subject.stream.listen((data) {
    print('Received: $data');
  });

  // Add data to the stream
  subject.add('Hello');
  subject.add('World');

  // Close the stream
  subject.close();
  subscription.cancel();
}
```
In this example, we import the `rxdart` package and create a `PublishSubject` which is a type of `StreamController` provided by `RxDart`. We subscribe to the stream using the listen method and print the received data.

We then add data to the stream using the add method and close the stream using the close method. Finally, we cancel the subscription using the cancel method to release the resources associated with the stream.

`RxDart` provides many powerful operators such as map, filter, debounce, throttle, and more, which allow you to transform, filter, and combine streams in a reactive manner. It enables you to handle complex asynchronous scenarios and build reactive and responsive Dart applications.

RxDart is a popular choice among Dart and Flutter developers for handling asynchronous events and working with streams in a reactive programming style.
