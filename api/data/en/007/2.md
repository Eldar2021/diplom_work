# Shared Preferences

Shared Preferences is a way to store and retrieve simple data in key-value pairs persistently. It is commonly used in mobile applications to store user preferences, settings, and small amounts of data. In Dart Flutter, you can use the `shared_preferences` package to work with shared preferences.

Here's an example of using Shared Preferences in Dart Flutter:
```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void main() async {
  // Get the shared preferences instance
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();

  // Store a value
  prefs.setString('username', 'John Doe');

  // Retrieve a value
  String username = prefs.getString('username');

  // Print the value
  print('Username: $username');
}
```
This example demonstrates how to store a value with a specific key (`username`) in shared preferences and retrieve it later. The value can be of different types like `String, int, double, bool`, etc.
